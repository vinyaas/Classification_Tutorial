    "**Handling Overfitting and Underfitting in Decision Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a popular and powerful machine learning algorithm, but they can suffer from overfitting and underfitting, just like any other algorithm. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",

    "**Overfitting in Decision Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting in decision trees can occur when the tree is too deep or when the number of features is too large. This can result in the tree learning the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. Some common signs of overfitting in decision trees include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High accuracy on the training data**: If the tree has a very high accuracy on the training data, but a low accuracy on the test data, it may be overfitting.\n",
    "* **Complex tree structure**: If the tree has a very complex structure, with many nodes and branches, it may be overfitting.\n",
    "* **Poor performance on unseen data**: If the tree performs poorly on unseen data, it may be overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques for Preventing Overfitting in Decision Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several techniques that can be used to prevent overfitting in decision trees, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pruning**: Pruning involves removing branches from the tree that do not contribute to the accuracy of the model. This can help to reduce overfitting by simplifying the tree structure.\n",
    "* **Early stopping**: Early stopping involves stopping the training process when the tree reaches a certain depth or when the accuracy on the validation set starts to decrease.\n",
    "* **Regularization**: Regularization involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to discourage the tree from becoming too complex.\n",
    "* **Feature selection**: Feature selection involves selecting a subset of the most relevant features to use in the tree. This can help to reduce overfitting by reducing the number of features that the tree can learn from.\n",
    "* **Ensemble methods**: Ensemble methods involve combining multiple trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. This can help to reduce overfitting by averaging out the errors of individual trees.\n",

    "Underfitting in decision trees can occur when the tree is too simple or when the number of features is too small. This can result in the tree failing to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Some common signs of underfitting in decision trees include:\n",
